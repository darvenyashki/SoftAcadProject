            <h2 class="section-heading">Why choose a villa for your luxury vacation</h2>
            <h3 class="side-page-heading"> While there are tons of great hotels out there, many of them offering excellent services, there comes a time when you just want something different, something more than just a hotel room to go back to after a day of sightseeing.

            <h4>
                1. Privacy
            </h4>
            <p class="sp-p">No loud hotel guests, no early wake up calls from housemaids, no swimming with thousands of people. A holiday villa affords you and your friends or family the privacy you deserve on vacation. They are ideal for couples seeking a romantic retreat all to themselves, or families wanting to spend some quality time together without being disturbed by hotel staff, but also for discreet travelers who treasure comfort and solitude. Not to mention, many of the luxury villas are located in private estates or gated communities, which means they offer high levels of security.</p>
            <h4>
                2. Additional space
            </h4>
            <p class="sp-p">Renting a villa is an excellent - and often surprisingly inexpensive - alternative to staying in a hotel, especially if you are traveling as a group or large family. Youll not only get way more space than in a hotel room, but you will also have the opportunity to relax in a variety of common areas as most of these properties boasts multiple socializing areas and beautiful outdoor terraces. Moreover, there will be plenty of living and dining space at your disposal, and the best part - you wont have to share the room with your children.</p>
            <h4>
                3. Facilities
            </h4>
            <p class="sp-p">Usually owned by individuals or families, private villas come with a wide range of amenities, from everyday comforts such as satellite TV, internet access, or laundry facilities to luxuries such as private swimming pools, entertainment rooms, home theaters, and even state-of-the-art fitness centers. Additionally, most of them have access to a garage, and come with beautiful gardens and multiple bathrooms. However, one of the highlights of your holiday villa will probably be the fully-equipped kitchen, where you will find all the appliances you need to cook your own meals. This will not only help you save a lot of money, but it will also offer you the chance to eat with your loved ones in a friendly, comfortable atmosphere.</p>

            <h4>
                4. Freedom
            </h4>
            <p class="sp-p">Vacation rentals provide a level of freedom and flexibility that no hotel room can match. Staying in a private villa while on holiday means saying goodbye to scheduled dining times and noise complaint calls from the front desk. You can come and go as you please, swim in your private pool at midnight, sunbathe topless, and even hang around all day in your nightgown if thats what you want.</p>
            <h4>
                5. Feel more like a local, less like a tourist
            </h4>
            <p class="sp-p">A major reason for choosing to stay at a holiday villa instead of a hotel or a resort is the authentic experience they offer. These properties are usually tastefully designed and filled with individual touches in order to make you feel right at home. And their fully fitted kitchens will encourage you experience the lifestyle and culture of the place, to pretend youre a native by perusing the local markets for the freshest ingredients.</p>
