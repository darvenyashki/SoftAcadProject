            <h2 class="section-heading">7 reasons to visit Crete</h2>
            <h3 class="side-page-heading">Crete is the largest island in Greece, and the fifth largest one in the Mediterranean Sea. Here, you can admire the remnants of brilliant civilizations, explore glorious beaches, impressive mountainscapes, fertile valleys and steep gorges, and become part of the island’s rich gastronomic culture. Crete is, after all, a small universe teeming with beauties and treasures that you will probably need a lifetime to uncover!</h3>

            </figure>

            <h4>Good to visit all year round</h4>
            <p class="sp-p">Being the southernmost among the Greek islands, Crete enjoys a pretty mild weather. Its good to visit throughout the whole year, but November through Feb get a bit more rain. So, March through October is perfect. Avoid the generally crowded July and August, when you also get the strong local winds.</p>

            <h4>Awesome beaches ahhh..</h4>
            <p class="sp-p">With more than 300 days of sunshine annually on average, Crete is definitely primarily a beach destination. One third of its 350 beaches have received the blue flag recognition for purity of their water and the cleanness of the coastal area. Balos lagoon and Falassarna are my favorites among those visited.</p>

            <h4>Lovely cities with great atmosphere</h4>
            <p class="sp-p">Within 3-4 days on the island we did say a few cities, the biggest among which were Iraklion (the capital) and Chania/Hania (second biggest city, our base). The atmosphere in those is rather relaxed, the streets are covered with blossoming flowers, there are cafes and small shops scattered everywhere..the typical Mediterranean atmosphere! Chania is claimed to be the spiritual capital of the island, with a lovely Venetian architecture that remained untouched during World War II (Crete was an overseas colony of the Republic of Venice between the 1200s and 1600s) and an amazing seaside walking alley.</p>

            </figure>

            <h4>Picturesque bays everywhere you turn</h4>
            <p class="sp-p">Crete is the biggest island of Greece and therefore can be best viewed by car. I really liked the many bays and picturesque sights opening from literally any part of the island. Balos and Mononaftis bay are just a couple of those you can enjoy</p>

            <h4>Taste delicious olive oil</h4>
            <p class="sp-p">Crete is one of the few islands of Greece that can survive without the tourism industry. How? Thanks to the huge production of olive oil. Almost every family on the island is producing their own olive oil, some for own needs, others to sell it. Crete produces more than half of the olive oil produced in the whole of Greece! Lots of oil factories offer guided tours through their facilities and oil tasting so – take the chance</p>

            <h4>Visit the ruins of the Palace of Knossos</h4>
            <p class="sp-p">The Palace of the Minoan King Knossos is the most famous attraction on the island and no wonder rarely can you see an archaeological site restored to such an extent. The restoration, made by the Oxford professor of archaeology Sir Arthur Evans has been a subject of vast discussions. The professor freely restored much more than is allowed for historical sites, and a great portion of that followed from his imagination on how the palace actually looked. Whether the palace looked like this or not, its very much worth visiting. Make sure to join a guided tour, very informative.</p>

            <h4>Take a day trip to Santorini</h4>
            <p class="sp-p">Never been to the famous Greek island of Santorini? Grab your chance to visit it without the hassle and expensive stay on this island. From Iraklion you can take a fast ferry (Flying Cat, no cars) and reach Santorini in less than 2 hours. Spend 6-7 hours on Santorini and return with the same animal (the cat I mean ;). Or, stay a night to enjoy the lovely sunset and night atmosphere on the white house island.</p>

            <h4>Try the <a href="cretanCuisine.html">Cretan cuisine</a></h4>
            <p class="sp-p">Cretan Food is a journey of flavors, delicious ingredients that you would never expect to taste. Crete has one of the oldest and most delicious gastronomic traditions in the world. Sure, its similar to the rest of Greece, but theres something unique and special about the Cretan way of cooking. Its healthy, its fresh (so fresh!), simple, yet extremely flavourful and of course, delicious. </p>
